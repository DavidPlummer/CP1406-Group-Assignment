<h1>CP1406 - Group Assignment. Barrier reef Orchestra - Project Plan</h1>

<p>Group: David, Jonathan, Michael, Jono </p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
    Mission Statement: The website is intended to increase member sign ups for Barrier Reef Orchestra, both spectators and musicians therefore
    increasing revenue and notariety;
    Intended methods include promoting offers/benefits to encourage new and existing members to join for future
    concecerts.

    .</p>

<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>

<p> The mission to increase membership and attendance will be measured via a few means;</p>
<ol>
    <li>The Evaluation will run a 3 month period (January - March) before the start of the new website, We will then
        reference back to the 3 month period
        before the website to compare the results to determine if we have reached our goal of at least a 50% increase
    </li>

    <li>Google analytics and rollout** can be used to maintain a register of new memberships via the website. It can also advise which
        sign up/links they used (determining what content
        was on that page) so that we can use this information in future events. This will also give the number of
        website membership sign ups.
    </li>
    <li>When new members enter the business in person, they can be asked to provide feedback about Barrier reef orchestra ie.
        "how did you hear about us" to determine if they have visited our our website.
    </li>
    <li>The sign up form will include the age of the new members so we can determine if the target audience is being
        reached (20-40)
    </li>
</ol>

<p>If the above results show a minimum of 50% increase in memberships from the website compared to the prevous 3 month pre
    website period, the website maybe considered a success.
    This will also provide a number of ways to improve the website based on the feedback provided by members, eg. what
    drew them towards becomming a member (promotions/events/concerts/competitions) so the company
    can utilise this information to target audiences in the future. Incorporate ongoing and monitering to evaluate the
    success of the website, marketing schemes ,increase revenue, generating new
    members and member retention.

</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>

<p>The target audience is between the ages of (20-40). From the client brief we have idenitified **************

    The site has been designed with a more adult-Mature layout in mind. Orchestra bringing toming the prestige feel of music, with
    professional refined and fine detailed aspects. Thus making people want to get involved or " want to join" such a prestigious
    organisation and attend these events. ****************

    There are sign up buttons for potential members to click on every page and when ever they see something they like. I
    have also added apropriate to read fonts and parragraphs.***************
